Since our first milestone, we have welcomed two additional members to our team. We have worked together to form a coherent plan and divided labor between ourselves 1) Frontend 2) Backend. We have drafted up an initial features plan, and have started working on merging our resources together. We have formed proper channels of communication between us utilizing slack and have set up an imessage group. Furthermore, we have begun researching react native syntax and how we can incorporate the framework to make our application frontend seamless and aligned with modern application development practices. We have formed a plan for the microservices to implement and have reached out to Duke OIT for further clarification regarding their API for login using netid. In this way we hope to have our app fully functional and aligned specifically for the Duke student body. We have not yet divided up tasks or made substantial individual progress, but we've all contributed evenly to the collective progress we've made.
